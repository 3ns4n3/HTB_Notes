After gaining shell check: 1. OS Version 2. Kernel Version 3. Running Services 

Basic commands to orient: 
1. whoami 
2. id - what groups does our user belong to
3. hostname -name and anything that can be learned from the naming convention
4. ifconfig or ip a - what subnet are we in, does the host have additional NICs in other subnets
5. sudo -l can we run anything as root without a password if we can drop into as root with sudo su = profit

Commands in walkthrough

cat /etc/os-release  : sows exact OS and anyversion info we may need. 

echo $PATH   : swhere linux looks everytime a command is executed for any executable... may be used to leverage priv escalation

env    : may get lucky and find a password, key or other sensitive info

* Check kernel version: may be able to exploit a vulnerable Kernel with a public exploit 
can use cat /proc/version or uname -a

* check CPU type/version
lscpu 

* check login shells that exist. tmux and Screen are particularlly useful apparently 
cat /etc/shells

check defenses to see if we can enumrate any of this.. 


    Exec Shield
    iptables
    AppArmor
    SELinux
    Fail2ban
    Snort
    Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)
* lsblk to enumerate information about block devices on the system
