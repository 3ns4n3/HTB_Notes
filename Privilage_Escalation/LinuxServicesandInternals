7. Is the host joined to an Active Directory domain?
8. What types of interesting information can we find in history, log, and backup files?
9. Which files have modified recently and how often? Are there any interesting patterns in file modification that could indicate a cron job in use that we may be able to hijack?
10. Current IP addressing information
11. Anything interesting in the /etc/hosts file?
12. Are there any interesting network connections to other systems in the internal network or even outside the network?
13. What tools are installed on the system that we may be able to take advantage of? (Netcat, Perl, Python, Runy, Nmap, tcpdumo, gcc, etc.) 
14. Can we access the bash_history file for any users and can we uncover anything from their recorded command line history such as passwords?
15. Are any Cron jobs running on the system that we may be able to hijack? 
16. Time to gather aas much network infomation as possible. 
-- current IP address
-- any other interfaces we could used to pivot into another subnet that was previously unreachable from attack host. (ip a / ifconfig) net tools must be present. 
** Internals **
1. Network Interfaces
-- ip a
2. Hosts 
-- /etc/hosts
3. User's last login
-- lastlog 
Logged In Users
- use either the w command, who command or finger
4. Command History 
- check users previous bash history 
- history 
5. Finding History Files 
- may need script to run to check old stuff. 
find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

6. Cron jobs 
ls -la /etc/cron.daily/
