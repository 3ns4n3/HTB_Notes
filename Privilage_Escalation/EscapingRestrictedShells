Examples:
1. RBASH restricted standard bourne shell
2. RKSH restricted version of Korn shell. 
3. RZSH restricted version of the Z shell. 

Ways out:
** Command Injection **
if we are able to run the ls command we can try command injection to add more commands. 

** Command Substitution **
 For example, imagine the shell allows users to execute commands by enclosing them in backticks (`). In that case,
it may be possible to escape from the shell by executing a command in a backtick substitution that is not restricted by the shell.

** Command Chaining **
use ; or | to execute a command. 

** Environment Variables **
 if the shell uses an environment variable to specify the directory in which commands are executed,
it may be possible to escape from the shell by modifying the value of the environment variable to specify a different directory.

** Shell Functions **
For this we can define and call shell functions that execute commands not restricted by the shell. Let us say, the shell allows users to define and call shell functions, 
it may be possible to escape from the shell by defining a shell function that executes a command.
